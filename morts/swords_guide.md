# Easter Egg
The easter egg for this map is a little bit nonlinear so I'm just going to put
the order I would do things in here.

## Step 1: Collect the pages (Slender)

Go to the sitting room and collect the pages in the room. They should be glowing
if you already talked to Krafft.  


## Step 2: Bottle Puzzle

1. Mark down the six bottles and their symbols in the bar room in spawn. They
   have Roman Numerals on them. 
2. Go to the water room and melee the broken part of the wall with melee
   macchiato to fully break it. 
3. Input the symbols in order.

## Step 3: Activate the Traps in Order

1. Look at the puzzles from top left bottom left top right bottom right as if you
were reading a book.
2. Activate the traps with the corresponding glowing symbols in order.
3. Kill zombies in there to complete it.

## Step 4: Activate the Statues
Look at the wall in the passageway to the basement that has all the sword
symbols on it. 

1. The symbols have a Roman Numeral next to it.
2. Hit Q to unleash the incantation and inspect the sword in front of the
   correct knight in order.
3. Repeat this with all the knights until a mystical orb drops from the sky.

Note: if the orb is in the air and doesn't descend then you have to jump from
the balcony and hold F to pick it up.

## Step 5: Activate the orb
In this step you'll take the orb around the map to fill it with souls.

1. Place the orb in the pedestal on the walls near where you filled up the
   incantation of the weapons. The order doesn't matter

| Sword | Location                             |
| :---: | :---:                                |
| Fire  |  Middle of the courtyard on the wall |
| Stag  |  Spawn near the chest                |
| Light |  Second floor balcony in sword room  |
| Void  |  Water room near the chest           |

## Step 6: Room
Go back to the room in the passageway to the basement and unlock it with the
orb. This will trigger a cutscene and you take the key.

## Step 7: Boss fight
Do the boss fight. Tier 3 drill will shred it. Definitely bring tier 3 weapons
but the drill should kill him very quick.

# Rat Easter Egg
For the rat easter egg you have to get cheese and scare rats by proning near
their location on the map.

## Cheese
There's a cheese shop in spawn. Break the windows and hold F to pick up the
cheese.

## Locations

1. Spawn in a flower pot on the left side
2. Nature path near deadshot in the stone wall, it lookd like a tiny cave
opening
3. Underneath the van after buying the first door on the right
4. Underneath the cannon on the broken stair on the macchiato side
5. Underneath chairs near Juggernog on the right side

8. Behind the tablet in the magic room (Alchemical Lab)
9. In the water room near a pillar next to the mysterbox location (Undercroft)
10. In a jail cell in the Dungeon. It should be the first cell (Dungeon) 

# Fix The Cannon Easter Egg
When you fire the cannon at the door to open the castle, the cannon breaks. This
is how to fix it.

## Step 1: Get the crank
The crank will fly off the handle and launch back to spawn. It will be at the
back of spawn near a box of bananas.

## Step 2: Get the blowtorch
Pick up the blowtorch. It's in the sword room, ground level in the right back
corner near a gas canister.

## Step 3: Fix the Cannon
Go back to the cannon and hold F where the crank is to fix the cannon.        

## 100 Times
Congratulations you can now turn the cannon around to the other side now. If you
fire yourself out the cannon towards spawn 100 times you get shot at and hit the
bell tower at spawn.
